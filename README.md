# MoneyMath - Quantitative Finance Project

The MoneyMath project is a Python application for quantitative analysis, processing, and visualizing stock market data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **live_price.py**: Fetches and displays live stock prices for specified stock symbols. It continuously updates the prices and clears the console for a clean display.

2. **arima_forecast.py**: Performs an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) analysis on historical stock prices, forecasting future stock prices, and visualizing the results.

3. **stock_graph_of_each_month.py**: Generates and saves graphs for each month based on processed stock data.

4. **lowprice_for_eachday.py**: Fetches and prints the lowest stock price for each day of a specified year. It fetches stock prices for each day using precise date adjustments and displays the lowest prices.

5. **monthly_price_comparison.py**: Compare the highest and lowest stock prices for each month of a given year and plot the results.

6. **approximation_tool.py**: Fits a curve to given data using a mathematical model and visualizes the fitted curve along with the original data points.

7. **investment_strat_1.py**: Simulates an investment strategy where income, expenses, and investment returns are considered over a specified number of years. It calculates the growth of investments and expenses over time and provides visualizations of the results.

8. **requirements.txt**: Specifies the required libraries and their versions for the project.
