# MoneyMath - Quantitative Finance Project

The MoneyMath project is a Python application for quantitative analysis, processing, and visualizing stock market data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **process_data.py**: Contains functions for processing stock data and saving it to the `output.txt` file. It is responsible for the initial processing of stock data.

2. **plot_graph.py**: Contains a function for plotting a graph based on the processed data. It takes the processed stock data and creates a visual representation in the form of a graph.

3. **precise_stock_price.py**: Fetches precise stock prices for a given stock, month, and year. It is a standalone script that can be used to get precise stock prices for specific periods.

4. **main.py**: Serves as the main entry point, calling functions from other files to execute the entire process. It provides a user-friendly interface for running the entire data processing and graph plotting workflow, including generating monthly graphs.

5. **stock_graph_of_each_month.py**: Generates and saves graphs for each month based on processed stock data. It uses the processed data obtained from `process_data.py` to create monthly stock price graphs.

6. **lowprice_for_eachday.py**: Fetches and prints the lowest stock price for each day of a specified year. It fetches stock prices for each day using `precise_stock_price.py` and displays the lowest prices.

7. **requirements.txt**: Specifies the required libraries and their versions for the project.

## Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the main.py file:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter the stock symbol, month, and year. The script will process the data, plot graphs, generate monthly graphs, and display the lowest stock prices for each day of the specified year.

## Notes

- The project is designed for quantitative finance analysis.
- It assumes a certain directory structure, so make sure to adjust file paths if needed.
- Customize the input prompts and messages as per your preferences.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
