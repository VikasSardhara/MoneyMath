# MoneyMath Project

The MoneyMath project is a Python application for processing and visualizing stock market data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. process_data.py: Contains functions for processing stock data and saving it to the `output.txt` file.

2. Run the main.py file:

   python main.py
 
   Follow the prompts to enter the stock symbol, month, and year.

## Notes

- The project assumes a certain directory structure, so make sure to adjust file paths if needed.
- Customize the input prompts and messages as per your preferences.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
